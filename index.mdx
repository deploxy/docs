## Features

Deploxy is a comprehensive deployment platform that allows you to:

-   **Deploy MCP servers privately:** Your source code remains secure on our servers, never exposed to end-users.
-   **Distribute lightweight proxies:** Users install minimal proxy packages from NPM that securely connect to your hosted logic.
-   **Scale automatically:** Leverage serverless infrastructure that handles traffic spikes without manual intervention.
-   **Focus on Your Logic:** No need to build a separate backend for secure tool calls or database connections.
-   **Deploy Globally:** Every deployment is automatically distributed across all supported regions for low-latency user experiences.

## Get Started

### 1. Create an Account

First, [create a free account on Deploxy](https://deploxy.com). You'll get a generous free tier with no credit card required.

### 2. Set up your Node.js Environment

Deploxy uses the standard Node.js ecosystem. Ensure you have **Node.js version 18 or higher** installed on your system.

### 3. Configure Your Auth Token

To connect the Deploxy CLI to your account, you need an authentication token.

1.  Go to the [Tokens page](https://deploxy.com/account/settings/tokens) in your Deploxy account settings.
2.  Create a new token and copy it.
3.  Store this token securely where it will not be exposed, for example, as an environment variable. The Quick Start guides will show you exactly how to use this token in your project.

Now you are ready to follow one of the Quick Start guides to deploy your first server!
