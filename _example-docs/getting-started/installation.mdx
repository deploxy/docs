# Installation

## Mac, Linux, and Windows

This installs the Deploxy CLI globally on your system via npm. This is the recommended installation method.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
npm install -g @deploxy/cli
</CodeBlock>

The CLI will help you manage your Deploxy projects, from initialization to deployment. After installation, you can verify it by running:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
deploxy --version
</CodeBlock>

## Using npx

If you prefer not to install the package globally, you can run Deploxy commands directly with `npx`.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
npx @deploxy/cli &lt;command&gt;
</CodeBlock>

## Initial Setup

<InstallStep step={1} title="Prerequisites">
  Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
  - **Node.js 18 or higher**
  - **npm or pnpm package manager**
  - **Git** (for version control)
  - **An NPM account** (for publishing your proxy package)
</InstallStep>

<InstallStep step={2} title="Create a Deploxy Account">
  If you haven't already, visit [deploxy.com](https://deploxy.com) and create your free account. You'll need this to:
  - Generate authentication tokens for the CLI.
  - Access the deployment dashboard.
  - Monitor your deployed services.
</InstallStep>

<InstallStep step={3} title="Generate an Authentication Token">
  1.  Log in to your Deploxy dashboard.
  2.  Navigate to **Account Settings > Tokens**.
  3.  Click **Create Token**.
  4.  Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "My Local Machine").
  5.  Copy the generated token. **Store it securely, as you will not be able to see it again.**

  This token will be used in your `.deploxy.json` configuration file.
</InstallStep>

<InstallStep step={4} title="Set Up NPM Authentication" isLast={true}>
  For Deploxy to publish the proxy package on your behalf, you need to authenticate with NPM. Create a `.npmrc` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

  <CodeBlock language="bash">
  //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${`{NPM_TOKEN}`}
  </CodeBlock>

  <Callout type="info" title="NPM Token Environment Variable">
    It is a best practice to store your NPM token in an environment variable (e.g., `NPM_TOKEN`) rather than committing it directly into the `.npmrc` file.
  </Callout>

  Make sure your NPM token has the necessary permissions to publish packages to your desired scope (e.g., `@your-org`).
</InstallStep>

## Upgrading

Once installed, you can upgrade the CLI by running:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
npm install -g @deploxy/cli@latest
</CodeBlock>

## Next Steps

Now that you have the Deploxy CLI installed and your environment configured, you're ready for your [First Deployment](./first-deployment).
