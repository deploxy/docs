# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using Deploxy and provides step-by-step solutions.

## Deployment Issues

### Deployment Fails with "Invalid Token"

**Symptom:** The `npx @deploxy/cli deploy` command fails with a `401 Unauthorized` error.

**Solution:**

1.  **Verify Your Token:** Ensure the `authToken` in your `.deploxy.json` is correct and has not expired.
2.  **Regenerate Token:** Go to the [Deploxy Dashboard](https://deploxy.com/account/settings/tokens), generate a new token, and update your configuration file.
3.  **Check for Typos:** Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters in the token string.

### Build Process Fails

**Symptom:** The deployment fails during the "Building project..." step.

**Solution:**

1.  **Run Build Locally:** The most common cause is a build error in your project. Run your build command locally to see the detailed error message. For example: `npm run build`.
2.  **Check `tsconfig.json`:** Ensure your `tsconfig.json` has a valid `outDir` specified and that the `include` array correctly points to your source files.
3.  **Check Dependencies:** Make sure all required `devDependencies` are listed in your `package.json`. The Deploxy build environment runs `npm install` before building.

### NPM Publishing Fails

**Symptom:** The deployment succeeds until the "Publishing to NPM..." step, which then fails.

**Solution:**

1.  **Check NPM Authentication:** Ensure your `.npmrc` file is present in the project root and contains a valid NPM token with publish permissions for your package scope.
2.  **Check Package Version:** NPM requires that you publish a new version every time. Before deploying, increment the `version` number in your `package.json`. The CLI will also validate this for you.
3.  **Check Package Name:** Ensure the `name` in your `package.json` is available on NPM and that you have permission to publish to that scope (e.g., `@your-org/my-package`).

## Runtime Issues

### MCP Server Not Responding or Timing Out

**Symptom:** Your deployed MCP server is not responding to requests, or requests are timing out.

**Solution:**

1.  **Check Runtime Logs:** This is the most important step. Use the Deploxy Dashboard or the CLI to view the real-time logs of your function.
    ```bash
    npx @deploxy/cli logs <deployment-id> --follow
    ```
    Look for any startup errors or exceptions that occur when a request comes in.
2.  **Check Environment Variables:** Ensure all required environment variables are correctly set in the `injectedEnv` section of your `.deploxy.json`. A missing database URL or API key is a common cause of startup failure.
3.  **Increase Timeout:** If your tool performs a long-running task, it might be exceeding the default serverless function timeout. You can increase this in your project settings (feature coming soon).

### "Invalid or Missing API Key"

**Symptom:** Users report getting an "Invalid API Key" error, even when they provide one.

**Solution:**

1.  **Verify Your Server Logic:** Double-check the authentication logic in your MCP server. Is it correctly retrieving the API key from the `request.params.arguments`?
2.  **Check Database Connection:** If you validate keys against a database, ensure your server can connect to it. Check the logs for any database connection errors.
3.  **Confirm User Input:** Ensure the user is passing the API key correctly in their MCP client configuration.

## Configuration Issues

### Environment Variables are `undefined`

**Symptom:** Your deployed server crashes because `process.env.MY_VARIABLE` is `undefined`.

**Solution:**

1.  **Check `.deploxy.json`:** Verify that the variable is defined in the `injectedEnv` section.
2.  **Check for Dynamic Variables:** If you are using dynamic variables (e.g., `"${process.env.MY_LOCAL_VAR}"`), ensure that the environment variable `MY_LOCAL_VAR` is set in the environment where you are running the `npx @deploxy/cli deploy` command. It will not be available if it's only in a `.env` file that isn't loaded by your shell.

<Callout type="info" title="Using .env files">
To load variables from a `.env` file before deploying, you can use a tool like `dotenv-cli`:
`npx dotenv -e .env.production -- npx @deploxy/cli deploy`
</Callout>
