# Deploxy Documentation

**The serverless proxy platform for Stdio MCP servers**

Deploxy is a comprehensive deployment platform that allows you to deploy Stdio MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to serverless infrastructure while keeping your source code private and secure. This repository contains the official documentation for the Deploxy platform.

## ðŸš€ What is Deploxy?

Deploxy solves the fundamental challenge of monetizing and securing MCP servers by providing:

- **Private Server Deployment**: Your MCP server code runs securely in our cloud environment, never exposed to end-users
- **Lightweight NPM Proxy**: Users install minimal proxy packages that securely connect to your hosted logic
- **Global Serverless Infrastructure**: Automatic scaling and distribution across all supported regions
- **Secure Environment Management**: Safe handling of API keys, database connections, and sensitive data
- **CLI-Driven Workflow**: Simple deployment process integrated into your development workflow

## ðŸ›  Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- Mintlify CLI

### Local Development

```bash
# Install Mintlify CLI globally
npm i -g mint
