# Plans

Deploxy offers different plans tailored to your project's scale and requirements. Below is a detailed breakdown of what each plan includes, focusing on the powerful global deployment and request routing features.

## Global Deployment for All Plans

A core feature of Deploxy is that **every deployment is a global deployment**. When you deploy your MCP server, it is automatically distributed across all of our [supported global regions](/resources/regions) at no extra cost, regardless of your plan.

This ensures that your application is positioned to serve a global audience with low latency. The key difference between the plans lies in how user requests are routed to these distributed servers.

## Hobby Plan

The Hobby plan is designed for personal projects, learning, and experimentation. It's completely free and does not require a credit card.

**Key Features:**

-   **10,000 MCP Operations per Month:** A generous allowance for development and small-scale applications.
-   **Fast Global Access:** Your serverless function is deployed across all of our [supported global regions](/resources/regions), ensuring your end-users worldwide can achieve low-latency connections.
    -   **Default Routing:** If an end-user makes a request without the `--region` flag, their request is routed to the `defaultDeployRegion` you set in your `.deploxy.json`.
    -   **Optimized Manual Routing:** For the best performance, your users can manually specify the region closest to them to minimize latency.
    ```bash
    # For low latency, a user in London should specify the eu-west-2 region
    npx -y @my-org/mcp --region eu-west-2
    ```
-   **Unlimited Projects and Deployments:** Create as many projects and deploy as often as you need.

## Pro Plan

The Pro plan is built for professional developers and applications that demand the best performance and user experience automatically.

**Key Features:**

-   **All features from the Hobby plan, plus:**
-   **10 Million MCP Operations per Month:** A significantly higher allowance for production traffic.
-   **Pay-as-you-go Scaling (Opt-in):** To ensure service continuity after exceeding your monthly allowance, you must enable **Usage-Based Charging**. This option is **disabled by default** for new Pro plan subscriptions.
    -   **If disabled (default):** Your service will be temporarily paused if you exceed 10 million operations, resuming in the next billing cycle.
    -   **If enabled:** You can continue to operate seamlessly. Any usage beyond your allowance is billed at **$0.10 per 10,000 extra operations**.
-   **Automatic Edge Routing:** This is the premier feature of the Pro plan. When a user makes a request without specifying a region, Deploxy's edge network automatically routes their request to the nearest, lowest-latency deployment. This provides the fastest possible response time for every user, wherever they are.
    ```bash
    # Request is automatically routed to the fastest region for the user
    npx -y @my-org/mcp
    ```
-   **Manual Region Override:** While routing is automatic, users still have the option to manually target a specific region if needed, giving them full control.
    ```bash
    # A user can still target a specific region if required
    npx -y @my-org/mcp --region=ap-northeast-2
    ```
-   **Python MCP Server Support (Coming Soon):** The Pro plan will include support for deploying MCP servers written in Python.
