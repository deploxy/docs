## What is the MCP Operation?

The core of our pricing is the **MCP Operation**. This is the unit we use to measure the usage of your deployed servers.

An MCP Operation can be one of the following:

-   **List Operation:** A request to list available resources, prompts, or tools.
-   **Call Operation:** A request to execute a resource, prompt, or tool.

### Memory-Based Calculation

The number of MCP Operations consumed by a request depends on the memory size configured for your serverless function. The formula is:

**`Consumed MCP Operations = Number of Requests * (Memory Size in MB / 256 MB)`**

For example:
-   A request to a function with **256MB** of memory consumes **1** MCP Operation.
-   A request to a function with **512MB** of memory consumes **2** MCP Operations.

This model ensures you only pay for the resources you actually use.

## Free Plan

The Free plan is perfect for personal projects, learning, and experimentation.

**Key Features:**

-   **Free 5,000 MCP Operations per Month:** A generous allowance for development and small-scale applications.
-   **1 Project:** You can manage one project under the Free plan.
-   **Manual Global Routing:** Your server is deployed globally. For the best performance, your users can manually specify the region closest to them to minimize latency. If no region is specified, requests go to your `defaultDeployRegion`.
    ```bash
    # For low latency, a user in London should specify the eu-west-2 region
    npx -y @my-org/mcp --region eu-west-2
    ```

## Pay as you go Plan

The Pay as you go plan is built for professional developers and applications that demand the best performance, scalability, and user experience.

**Key Features:**

-   **Free 10,000 MCP Operations per Month:** A larger free allowance for your applications.
-   **Unlimited Projects:** Create and manage as many projects as you need.
-   **Pay-as-you-go for Extra Usage:** Never worry about hitting a hard limit. Once you've used your free operations, you're billed at **$1 per 1,000 extra operations**.
-   **Set a Budget Limit:** To avoid unexpected costs, you can set a monthly spending limit for extra usage. You can even set it to $0 to cap usage at the free allowance.
-   **Automatic Edge Routing:** This is the premier feature of the Pay as you go plan. Deploxy's edge network automatically routes user requests to the nearest, lowest-latency deployment, providing the fastest possible response time for every user, wherever they are.
    ```bash
    # Request is automatically routed to the fastest region for the user
    npx -y @my-org/mcp
    ```
-   **Manual Region Override:** While routing is automatic, users still have the option to manually target a specific region if needed.
