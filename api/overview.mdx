# API Overview

<Callout type="info" title="ðŸ“š API Documentation">
  Deploxy provides multiple ways to interact with your deployed MCP servers and the platform itself: through the Deploxy CLI and the user-facing MCP Proxy API.
</Callout>

## API Types

Deploxy offers two primary interfaces for interaction:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
  <FeatureCard 
    icon="Terminal" 
    title="Deploxy CLI" 
    description="The primary tool for deploying and managing your projects."
  >
    Perfect for local development and integration into CI/CD pipelines.
  </FeatureCard>
  
  <FeatureCard 
    icon="Code" 
    title="MCP Proxy API" 
    description="The deployed serverless endpoint that your users' clients interact with."
  >
    This is the public-facing interface of your private MCP server logic.
  </FeatureCard>
</div>

## Authentication

Authentication is handled differently for each interface.

### Deploxy CLI Authentication

The CLI requires a **Personal Access Token** to authenticate with the Deploxy platform for deployments and management tasks.

-   **Source**: Generated from the [Deploxy Dashboard](https://deploxy.com/dashboard/tokens).
-   **Usage**: Stored in the `authToken` field of your `.deploxy.json` file.

<Callout type="warning" title="ðŸ”‘ Keep Your Token Secure">
  Your Deploxy auth token grants access to manage your projects. Do not commit it directly to version control. Use environment variables for better security.
</Callout>

### MCP Proxy API Authentication

Securing your deployed MCP server is your responsibility. You implement the authentication logic directly in your server code. This provides flexibility and control.

A common pattern is to require an API key passed in the tool call arguments.

<CodeBlock title="Server-Side API Key Validation" language="typescript">
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const apiKey = request.params.arguments.apiKey;

  if (!isValid(apiKey)) {
    throw new Error('Authentication failed');
  }
  
  // ... proceed with tool logic
});
```
</CodeBlock>

## MCP Proxy URL

When you deploy a project, Deploxy generates a unique, secure URL for your serverless function. The `@deploxy/proxy` package uses this URL to route requests from the end-user's client to your private server.

<CodeBlock title="MCP Proxy URL Structure" language="bash">
# The URL is automatically configured in the published proxy package.
https://{deployment-id}.deploxy.com{mcp-path}

# Example:
https://abc123xyz.deploxy.com/mcp
</CodeBlock>
