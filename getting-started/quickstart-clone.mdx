# Hello World Example

This guide is the fastest way to get started with Deploxy. We'll clone a ready-made MCP server, configure it, and deploy it in less than 5 minutes.

<Steps>

<Step title="Clone the Quick Start Repository">
This repository contains a simple "hello world" MCP server.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deploxy/quick-start.git
cd quick-start
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Project">
Next, you'll configure the project with your details.

1.  **Set Package Name:** Open `package.json` and change the `name` to something unique that you can publish on NPM, like `@your-npm-username/my-first-deploxy-server`.

2.  **Configure NPM Auth:** Create a file named `.npmrc` in the project root. It's a critical security practice to use an environment variable for your token.
    ```bash .npmrc
    //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
    ```

3.  **Configure Deploxy:** Create a file named `.deploxy.json`. The easiest way is to use the [Project Creator](https://deploxy.com/dashboard/new) on your dashboard and copy the generated JSON.
    A minimal configuration looks like this:
    ```json .deploxy.json
    {
      "authToken": "${process.env.DEPLOXY_TOKEN}",
      "defaultDeployRegion": "ap-northeast-2"
    }
    ```
<Warning>
Before deploying, ensure you have set the `DEPLOXY_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` environment variables in your shell. You can get your Deploxy token from the [API Keys page](https://deploxy.com/account/settings/tokens).
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy with Deploxy">
Now, run the deploy command. This single command will securely upload your server, build it, deploy it globally, and publish the lightweight proxy package to NPM.
```bash
npx @deploxy/cli deploy
```
<Check>
That's it! You can monitor the deployment on your [Deploxy Dashboard](https://deploxy.com/dashboard). Once complete, you can run your new MCP server from anywhere with `npx`.
