# Introduction to Deploxy

<Info>
  In this guide, you'll learn about Deploxy's core concepts, how it works, and why it's the perfect solution for deploying private MCP servers.
</Info>

Welcome to Deploxy, the platform for deploying your MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to serverless infrastructure while keeping your source code private and secure.

## What is Deploxy?

Deploxy is a comprehensive deployment platform that allows you to:

</CardGroup>

## How It Works

The Deploxy platform follows a simple but powerful architecture:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Write Your MCP Server">
    Build your MCP server with all your business logic, database connections, and private functionality. This runs entirely in Deploxy's secure cloud environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy with the Deploxy CLI">
    Using our CLI tool, your code is securely uploaded to our infrastructure where it's built and deployed as a serverless function.
  </Step>
  <Step title="We Generate a Proxy Package">
    Deploxy automatically creates a lightweight NPM package that acts as a proxy to your private server. This proxy is what you'll publish for your users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Users Install the Proxy">
    Your users install the proxy package via NPM, which seamlessly connects to your secure server without ever exposing your source code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Architecture Overview

Here's how Deploxy's architecture ensures both security and performance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your MCP Server Code] --> B(Deploxy CLI);
    B -- Upload --> Deploxy-Cloud{Deploxy Cloud};
    subgraph Deploxy-Cloud
        D[Build & Deploy] --> E["Serverless Function 
        (Your MCP Server Code)"];
        E --> F[Generate Proxy Code];
    end
    F -- Publish --> G[NPM Registry];
    H[End User] -- npm install --> G;
    H -- npx your-pkg --> I[Proxy Client];
    I -- MCP Call --> E;
    E -- Streaming Response --> I;
```

<Warning>
  Your source code is **never** exposed to end users. The proxy package only contains connection logic, while your business logic remains secure in Deploxy's cloud.
</Warning>
