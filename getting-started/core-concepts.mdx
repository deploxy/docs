# Core Concepts

This document explains the key concepts behind Deploxy, providing a solid foundation for understanding how the platform works.

## The Core Problem: Private MCP Servers

Standard NPM packages are public, meaning anyone can view their source code. This is a problem for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that contain proprietary business logic, connect to private databases, or use secret API keys.

Deploxy solves this by allowing you to deploy your MCP server to a secure, private, serverless environment while distributing a lightweight, public-facing proxy package to your users.

## 1. The Private MCP Server

Your MCP server is the core of your application. It contains all your valuable logic:
-   Proprietary algorithms and business logic.
-   Connections to your private databases.
-   Secure handling of API keys and other secrets.

With Deploxy, you write this code as a standard Node.js application. During deployment, this code is uploaded directly to a secure serverless environment and is **never** published to a public registry.

## 2. The Lightweight Proxy Package

When you deploy with `npx @deploxy/cli deploy`, Deploxy automatically generates a new, minimal NPM package. This is the **proxy package**.

-   **What it is:** A small, lightweight client that knows how to connect to your private MCP server.
-   **What it contains:** Only the necessary logic to forward a user's request (e.g., a tool call) to your secure server and stream the response back.
-   **What it does NOT contain:** Any of your sensitive source code, database credentials, or secret keys.

This proxy package is what you publish to NPM. Your end-users install this package, giving them access to your MCP server's functionality without ever seeing the underlying implementation.

## 3. The Serverless Architecture

Your private MCP server code runs on highly scalable and resilient serverless infrastructure (like AWS Lambda).

-   **Auto-Scaling:** The platform automatically handles traffic spikes, scaling your server up or down as needed. You don't need to manage servers.
-   **High Availability:** Serverless functions are inherently resilient, providing a stable experience for your users.
-   **Pay-per-use:** You only pay for the compute time you consume, making it a cost-effective solution.

## 4. Configuration via `.deploxy.json`

The `.deploxy.json` file is the control center for your project. It tells the Deploxy CLI everything it needs to know to deploy and manage your server.

Key settings include:
-   `authToken`: Your secret token for authenticating with the Deploxy platform.
-   `injectedEnv`: A secure map of environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL` or `API_KEY`) that are made available to your private server at runtime.
-   `defaultDeployRegion`: The geographical region where your server will be deployed, allowing you to place it closer to your users for lower latency.

## 5. The CLI-Driven Workflow

Deploxy is designed to be integrated directly into your development and CI/CD workflow via the `@deploxy/cli`.

-   `npx @deploxy/cli init`: Initializes a new project with a `.deploxy.json` file.
-   `npx @deploxy/cli deploy`: The core command that bundles your code, uploads it securely, deploys it to the serverless environment, and publishes the proxy package to NPM.
-   `npx @deploxy/cli logs`: Allows you to view the real-time logs of your running MCP server for debugging and monitoring.

This workflow allows you to automate deployments and manage your application's lifecycle directly from your terminal or CI/CD pipeline.
