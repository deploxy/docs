# Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up your environment for deployment with Deploxy.

## Using the CLI

You can run all Deploxy commands directly with `npx`, which avoids global installation.

To run a command, simply prefix it with `npx`:
```bash
npx @deploxy/cli <command>
```

To verify your setup, you can run:
```bash
npx @deploxy/cli --version
```


## Initial Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">
  Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
  - **Node.js 18 or higher**
  - **npm or pnpm package manager**
  - **Git** (for version control)
  - **An NPM account** (for publishing your proxy package)
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Deploxy Account">
  If you haven't already, visit [deploxy.com](https://deploxy.com) and create your free account. You'll need this to:
  - Generate authentication tokens for the CLI.
  - Access the deployment dashboard.
  - Monitor your deployed services.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate an Authentication Token">
  1.  Log in to your Deploxy dashboard.
  2.  Navigate to **Account Settings > Tokens**.
  3.  Click **Create Token**.
  4.  Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "My Local Machine").
  5.  Copy the generated token. **Store it securely, as you will not be able to see it again.**

  This token will be used in your `.deploxy.json` configuration file.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up NPM Authentication">
  For Deploxy to publish the proxy package on your behalf, you need to authenticate with NPM. Create a `.npmrc` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

  ```bash
  //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
  ```

  <Info>
    It is a best practice to store your NPM token in an environment variable (e.g., `NPM_TOKEN`) rather than committing it directly into the `.npmrc` file.
  </Info>

  Make sure your NPM token has the necessary permissions to publish packages to your desired scope (e.g., `@your-org`).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have the Deploxy CLI installed and your environment configured, you're ready for your [First Deployment](./first-deployment).
