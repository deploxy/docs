# Deploy your existing project

This guide covers the setup process for deploying your existing Node.js project with Deploxy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Prerequisites">
    Ensure you have the following:
    - A [Deploxy Account](https://deploxy.com) and an [NPM Account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).
    - **Node.js 18 or higher** installed.
    - Your project's `package.json` is configured for publishing with the correct `name`, `version`, `files`, and `main` properties.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Project">
    Next, add the necessary Deploxy and NPM configuration files to your project.

    **1. Create `.npmrc`:** Create a file named `.npmrc` in your project root to authenticate with NPM. Using an environment variable for your token is a critical security practice.
    ```bash .npmrc
    //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
    ```

    **2. Create `.deploxy.json`:** Create a file named `.deploxy.json` to configure your deployment. The easiest way to create this file is by using the [Project Creator](https://deploxy.com/dashboard/new) on your dashboard, which provides a user-friendly interface to generate the configuration. Once generated, simply copy it into your project root.

    A minimal configuration looks like this:
    ```json .deploxy.json
    {
      "authToken": "YOUR_DEPLOXY_TOKEN",
      "defaultDeployRegion": "us-east-1",
      "stdioArgsIndex": "--args",
      "mcpPath": "/mcp",
      "packageType": "js",
      "injectedEnv": {}
    }
    ```
    <Warning>
    Before deploying, ensure you have set the `DEPLOXY_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` environment variables in your shell. You can get your Deploxy token from the [Tokens page](https://deploxy.com/account/settings/tokens).
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Your Project">
    With the configuration complete, you are ready to deploy.
    ```bash
    npx @deploxy/cli deploy
    ```
    This command securely uploads your server logic, deploys it globally, and publishes the lightweight proxy package to NPM.

    You can monitor the deployment progress on your [Deploxy Dashboard](https://deploxy.com/dashboard).
